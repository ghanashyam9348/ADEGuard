I was able to get out the words \"911\" and \"stroke\" to my daughter. Long story short, I the ambulance took me to the ER where they couldn't figure it out. I was offered Ativan for an anxiety attack which it was not and I refused. After several hours, I was finally able to move about normally. I had 4 more if these attacks over the next 4 weeks. Since then, my fatigue had reached an all time extreme. I have had multiple issues where I felt like my chest would explode out of my chest because it was breathing so hard. Not from running a marathon, from carrying in groceries. I have had many times where I've become very nauseated such as standing in a long line waiting to vote. I have had times where I did vomit, repeatedly. From just taking a shower without sit breaks. I can no longer cook a quick meal because I become so fatigued from standing longer than a few minutes. My whole life is upside down. My doctor says I have RA, but I have no pain or swelling that I can see anywhere. My inflammation markers and RF factor it through the roof. I'm not able to see a rheumatologist until October 2025.",

Today no fever, still throat tightness and slightly puffy face. Kept him home today. No diarrhea. Arm is better today. Pulse OX on Saturday read 73-83, felt SOB - book said he was still in the normal range. Pulse OX yesterday was 93% and 97% today. Told mom I think he needs to be seen- placed on hold and relayed the above and he states he should be seen in UC. Recommended that he be seen in UC given the ongoing throat tightness and puffy face- may need steroid/antihistamines- mom asked if she could just give him Benadryl- needs documentation of symptoms- should be seen- mom plans to take to clinic.

He went to the ER on 10/10/24, and he was in and out of the ER, hospital, and inpatient rehab for four weeks. My family and I finally got him back home on 11/5/24. A week later on 11/11/24, he was in the ER again. The next day my family decided to put him on hospice at home He passed away at home on 11/25/24. I was his primary caregiver. Please see my detailed description below about what happened. PLEASE NOTE: I strongly feel that people of advanced age like my Dad should only receive one vaccination at a time, and that this should also be the case for people with dementia/Alzheimer's. If a vulnerable person has just completed a round of antibiotics, perhaps a specified period of time--longer than just a couple of days--should be allowed to pass before a person receives a vaccination. I urge the government to consider modifying its vaccination recommendations accordingly. My father received his annual flu and covid shots during the same pharmacy visit on Sunday, October 6, 2024. He had received both shots at the same time the previous year without a single side effect. However, in October 2024 he was a year older, and his dementia had presumably progressed some since the fall of 2023. Prior to receiving covid and flu shots on 10/6/2024, Dad had been taking a 2-week round of antibiotics to treat an H-pylori infection. From Friday, 9/20/2024 through Thursday, 10/3/24, Dad was taking the following antibiotics and other related medications at the direction of his pharmacy care doctor's office: amoxicillin; levofloxacin; omeprazole; and probiotics. At my sister's suggestion, I purchased Culturelle Ultimate Strength Probiotic to help ensure that at 94 years old, my Dad's body would be able to handle his ingestion of antibiotics multiple times a day for two weeks. Fortunately, he tolerated the regimen very well. On 9/30/24 I contacted Dad",
